  abstract = {Background
Establishing influenza thresholds and transmission intensity can help evaluate seasonal changes in influenza severity and potential pandemics. We aimed to evaluate the moving epidemic method (MEM) for calculating influenza thresholds for season 2016/17 in Egypt using four parameters, to identify the most useful parameter. Also to measure the agreement between both the country-specific statistical empirical method and World Health Organization method to MEM for determining the length and intensity level of activity of the influenza season.
Methods
Routinely epidemiological and laboratory data from sentinel surveillance sites for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) were used for calculating thresholds for seasons between 2010/11 and 2015/16 to test 2016/17 season. The parameters calculated were: screened ILI consultation rate × 1000, screened ILI composite parameter, influenza positivity percentage among sampled SARI cases, and influenza positivity percentage among sampled ILI and SARI cases. These parameters assess seasonality and intensity of influenza activity using the three proposed methods (mentioned above). Agreement between the three methods was done using several approaches.
Results
The intensity of influenza activity by MEM was lower than the other two methods. Agreement between MEM and each of the other two techniques varied appreciably from good to very good for seasonal duration, and poor to fair for intensity level. In addition, parameters including laboratory data showed a pattern of bi-wave activity; the first wave occurred in winter mostly between epidemiological weeks 39 and 52 and the second occurred in spring mostly between weeks 12 and 17.
Conclusion
Parameters including laboratory data were more useful in defining seasonality of influenza. Further exploration of the MEM model in future seasons may help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its use and application.},

We used the moving epidemic method to develop intensity thresholds (ITs) for 3 US surveillance indicators from the 2003–2004 through 2014–2015 influenza seasons (excluding the 2009 pandemic). The indicators were: 1) outpatient visits for influenza-like illness; 2) influenza-related hospitalizations; and 3) influenza- and pneumonia-related deaths. ITs were developed for the population overall and separately for children, adults, and older adults, and they were set at the upper limit of the 50\\% (IT50), 90\\% (IT90), and 98\\% (IT98) 1-sided confidence intervals of the geometric mean of each season’s 3 highest values. Severity was classified as low if ≥2 systems peaked below IT50, moderate if ≥2 peaked between IT50 and IT90, high if ≥2 peaked between IT90 and IT98, and very high if ≥2 peaked above IT98. We pilot-tested this method with the 2015–2016 season and the 2009 pandemic. Overall, 4 seasons were classified as low severity, 7 as moderate, 2 as high, and none as very high. Among the age groups, older adults had the most seasons (n = 3) classified as high, and children were the only group to have seasons (n = 2) classified as very high. We will apply this method to classify the severity of future seasons and inform pandemic response.}},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Defining the start and assessing the intensity of influenza seasons are essential to ensure timely preventive and control measures and to contribute to the pandemic preparedness. The present study aimed to determine the epidemic and intensity thresholds of influenza season in Tunisia using the moving epidemic method. Methods We applied the moving epidemic method (MEM) using the R Language implementation (package “mem”). We have calculated the epidemic and the different intensity thresholds from historical data of the past nine influenza seasons (2009-2010 to 2017-2018) and assessed the impact of the 2009-2010 pandemic year. Data used were the weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) proportions compared with all outpatient acute consultations. The goodness of the model was assessed using a cross validation procedure. Results The average duration of influenza epidemic during a typical season was 20 weeks and ranged from 11 weeks (2009-2010 season) to 23 weeks (2015-2016 season). The epidemic threshold with the exclusion of the pandemic season was 6.25\%. It had a very high sensitivity of 85\% and a high specificity of 69\%. The different levels of intensity were established as follows: low, if ILI proportion is below 9.74\%, medium below 12.05\%; high below 13.27\%; and very high above this last rate. Conclusions This is the first mathematically based study of seasonal threshold of influenza in Tunisia. As in other studies in different countries, the model has shown both good specificity and sensitivity, which allows timely and accurate detection of the start of influenza seasons. The findings will contribute to the development of more efficient measures for influenza prevention and control.},

Objectives  (i) To calculate the epidemic threshold for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in 19 countries, as well as the thresholds for different levels of intensity. (ii) To evaluate the performance of these thresholds. Methods  The moving epidemic method (MEM) has been developed to determine the baseline influenza activity and an epidemic threshold. False alerts, detection lags and timeliness of the detection of epidemics were calculated. The performance was evaluated using a cross-validation procedure. Results  The overall sensitivity of the MEM threshold was 71·8\% and the specificity was 95·5\%. The median of the timeliness was 1 week (range: 0–4·5). Conclusions  The method produced a robust and specific signal to detect influenza epidemics. The good balance between the sensitivity and specificity of the epidemic threshold to detect seasonal epidemics and avoid false alerts has advantages for public health purposes. This method may serve as standard to define the start of the annual influenza epidemic in countries in Europe.},

  abstract = {Objectives Although influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) surveillance are well established in Europe, the comparability of intensity among countries and seasons remains an unresolved challenge. The objective is to compare the intensity of ILI and ARI in some European countries. Design and setting Weekly ILI and ARI incidence rates and proportion of primary care consultations were modeled in 28 countries for the 1996/1997–2013/2014 seasons using the moving epidemic method (MEM). We calculated the epidemic threshold and three intensity thresholds, which delimit five intensity levels: baseline, low, medium, high, and very high. The intensity of 2013/2014 season is described and compared by country. Results The lowest ILI epidemic thresholds appeared in Sweden and Estonia (below 10 cases per 100 000) and the highest in Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, and Slovakia (above 100 per 100 000). The 2009/2010 season was the most intense, with 35\% of the countries showing high or very high intensity levels. The European epidemic period in season 2013/2014 started in January 2014 in Spain, Poland, and Greece. The intensity was between low and medium and only Greece reached the high intensity level, in weeks 7 to 9/2014. Some countries remained at the baseline level throughout the entire surveillance period. Conclusions Epidemic and intensity thresholds varied by country. Influenza-like illnesses and ARI levels normalized by MEM in 2013/2014 showed that the intensity of the season in Europe was between low and medium in most of the countries. Comparing intensity among seasons or countries is essential for understanding patterns in seasonal epidemics. An automated standardized model for comparison should be implemented at national and international levels.},
